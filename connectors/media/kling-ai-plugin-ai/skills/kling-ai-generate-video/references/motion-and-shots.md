# Motion and shot planning

## Motion-first prompt order

1. Format and duration intent.
2. Opening frame and subject placement.
3. Primary subject action with beginning, progression, and end beat.
4. Camera action and speed.
5. Environmental motion and physical effects.
6. Lighting, palette, lens feel, and temporal atmosphere.
7. Continuity locks: identity, wardrobe, product geometry, logo, architecture, screen direction.
8. Constraints: no extra subjects, no morphing, no unsolicited text or watermark.

## Camera vocabulary

- `locked-off`: observation, product detail, graphic composition
- `slow push-in`: emphasis, intimacy, reveal of detail
- `pull-back reveal`: expand context or scale
- `lateral tracking`: follow motion while preserving profile/geography
- `orbit`: dimensional product/character reveal; keep speed restrained
- `crane rise/drop`: establish or conclude with scale
- `handheld follow`: urgency or UGC authenticity; specify controlled versus energetic
- `whip pan`: transition or impact; use sparingly and only with a clear landing subject

Do not stack several camera verbs in a five-second shot.

## Short-duration fit

- 5 seconds: one action and one camera move.
- 10 seconds: one action with setup/payoff, or two simple connected beats.
- 15 seconds: compact three-beat sequence when supported, otherwise one developed continuous shot.

Treat these as planning heuristics, not provider capabilities; use only duration values accepted by the live schema.

## Multi-shot template

```text
SHOT 1 — <duration>: <framing>; <single story job>; <subject action>; <camera action>.
Continuity: <identity/product/location anchors>.

SHOT 2 — <duration>: <framing>; <new story job>; <subject action>; <camera action>.
Continuity: preserve <anchors>; transition via <match/action/screen direction>.
```

Keep the total duration consistent. Each shot should add information rather than repeat a prettier angle.

## Reference handling

- First-frame input: preserve composition and animate within it.
- Multiple references: identify each role explicitly; do not treat all images as interchangeable style inputs.
- Character continuity: lock face, age presentation, hair, wardrobe, proportions, and distinctive features.
- Product continuity: lock dimensions, materials, label spelling, logo placement, and moving-part behavior.

## Motion-control assets

- Keep the person or animal clearly visible in the subject image and match the body framing to the motion-source video when possible.
- Use one continuous motion-source shot; avoid cuts, occlusion, extremely fast movement, or multiple competing subjects.
- Kling's current official guide recommends a 3–30 second motion video, a short edge of at least 340 px, and a long edge no greater than 3850 px. Enforce any stricter live MCP schema constraint.
- `motion_control` requires the subject `image` and exactly one of library `motionId` or input `video`. Use only direction, resolution, and original-sound fields declared by the current model in `who_am_i`.

## Ads and explainers

Assign one communication job per beat:

- hook: earn attention without a false claim
- context: show the problem or setting
- proof: demonstrate a real product/action/detail
- payoff: hero result or supplied message

Do not invent performance claims, user testimony, statistics, pricing, awards, certifications, or regulatory statements.

## Submission check

Check duration, resolution, ratio, shot structure, and protected elements
internally before submission. Do not show a pre-submission process message,
credit warning, or separate confirmation unless a creative requirement is
missing and the user must clarify it.
