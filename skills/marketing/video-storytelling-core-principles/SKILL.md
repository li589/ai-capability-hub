## 1. The “smoke and fire” rule (make it concrete)

*   **Reject vague grandeur**: Do **not** build visuals around abstract buzzwords like “system,” “architecture,” “underlying logic,” or “empowerment.”
*   **Use lived-in detail**: Map ideas to warm, everyday scenes—e.g. multi-agent teamwork as **tiny kitchen sprites dividing cake work**; single-model limits as **one person juggling chores until everything breaks**.
*   **Stress texture**: Prompts must highlight **physical material** (flour dust, cream sheen, strawberry color, oven glow) for “food appeal” or **satisfying, tactile** life moments.

## 2. The “mute” test

*   **Picture = story**: If you **mute** narration and dialogue, the audience should still follow setup, turn, and payoff. Voiceover **annotates** the image—images must not become a **slide deck for the VO**.
*   **Visual loop and contrast**:
  *   Problem and solution should read through **visual contrast**, not explanation-only VO.
  *   **Weak**: Scene 1 VO “solo is exhausting,” girl sighs; Scene 4 VO “teamwork is easy,” girl smiles—same vague staging.
  *   **Strong**: Scene 1—girl whisks with one hand and struggles to pour flour with the other → **flour explosion** (solo pain). Scene 4—friend takes whisking; girl can **sift flour calmly** (team gain). **Action contrast** closes the loop.

## 3. Physical logic and action breakdown

*   **Visible failure and success**:
  *   Conflict and outcome cannot be a vague label—they must split into **visible physical causes**.
  *   **Weak**: “She failed at the cake and got flour on her face.” (Why the face?)
  *   **Strong**: “Left hand whisks, right hand strains holding the flour bag, recipe in teeth. A sneeze drops the paper; hands slip; the bag tips and **flour blasts upward into her face**.” Tight chain, self-consistent motion.
*   **Visual bridge for the “aha”**:
  *   You cannot jump from “stuck” to “solution” without a **seen** link.
  *   If inspiration comes from watching something (e.g. ants), show **face change** (eyes widen, smile) and **physical action** (grabs a crayon)—then the next beat (drawing a plan) feels earned.

## 4. Camera narrative and transitions

*   **Motion serves physics**:
  *   Push, pull, pan, tilt must have a **story reason**—not motion for its own sake.
  *   Example: for a **sudden flour burst** hitting the face, keep the camera **locked (wide)** so flour **flies toward lens**—don’t chase the particles with the camera and dilute impact.
*   **In-scene transitions (no arbitrary black)**:
  *   Avoid lazy black frames or random hard cuts. Bridge shots with **moving or glowing elements already in frame**.
  *   **Example A (occlusion)**: A flour speck flies straight at a **fixed** camera, whites out the frame; white clears into a **micro world** shot.
  *   **Example B (light)**: An icon on paper **glows**; glow expands to fill screen; fade reveals a real kitchen counter.

## 5. Character consistency and sync

*   **Start/end consistency**: In diffusion video prompts, require **stable identity**—same character, outfit, and general framing **unless** a deliberate occlusion or scene reset (e.g. explicit style line: “same person, same clothes, same hairstyle as previous shot”).
*   **Multi-character action sync**: When several characters speak, the script must include a **beat timeline** (e.g. `[0–2s] A speaks`, `[2–5s] B speaks`) and specify **gesture size** and **mouth movement** in each window so picture matches dubbing.

## 6. Structure and pacing

*   **Compact three acts** (example for ~60s):
  *   **Opening (0–10s)**: Pain point—impossible task or chaos.
  *   **Middle (10–40s)**: Turning point (observe nature, code sketch, etc.)—dense execution and teamwork.
  *   **Ending (40–60s)**: Payoff—result, catharsis, theme lift.
*   **VO speed and breathing room**: Keep Mandarin VO at or below **~4.5 characters per second**. **Cut copy** before you cram frames—leave time for **physical acting**, **SFX**, and the viewer’s eye to rest.
