# L2: Standard Workflow

Complete workflow for regular feature development.

> **Note:** All `./scripts/` paths below are relative to `{skill_root}` (the directory containing SKILL.md). Use absolute path in actual execution.

## Overview

```
INIT → ANALYZING → PLANNING → DESIGNING → IMPLEMENTING → TESTING → DELIVERING → DONE
```

| Property    | Value                                                 |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Target Time | 1-8 hours                                             |
| Outputs     | spec.md, design.md, tasks.md, checklist.md, report.md |
| Best For    | Most feature development                              |

## Stages

### Stage 1: INIT → ANALYZING

**Trigger:** Workflow initialization complete

**AI Actions:**

1. Understand user requirements
2. Ask clarifying questions (if needed)
3. Document requirements in `spec.md`

**Output (spec.md):**

```markdown
# Requirements: {name}

## Background

{Why this feature is needed}

## Objectives

{What the feature should achieve}

## Scope

- In Scope: {included features}
- Out of Scope: {explicitly excluded}

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] {criterion_1}
- [ ] {criterion_2}
```

**Transition:**

```bash
./scripts/advance-stage.sh -r /project --to ANALYZING
```

### Stage 2: ANALYZING → PLANNING

**Trigger:** Requirements clear, spec.md complete

**AI Actions:**

1. Analyze existing codebase
2. Identify affected modules
3. Plan technical approach
4. Create task list (`tasks.md`)

**Output (tasks.md):**

```markdown
# Task List

## Phase 1: Preparation

- [ ] Task 1.1
- [ ] Task 1.2

## Phase 2: Core Implementation

- [ ] Task 2.1
- [ ] Task 2.2

## Phase 3: Testing and Polish

- [ ] Task 3.1
```

**Transition:**

```bash
./scripts/advance-stage.sh -r /project --to PLANNING
```

### Stage 3: PLANNING → DESIGNING

**Trigger:** Task planning complete

**AI Actions:**

1. Design technical solution
2. Define API interfaces (if applicable)
3. Design data structures
4. Document in `design.md`

**Output (design.md):**

```markdown
# Technical Design: {name}

## Solution Overview

{High-level design approach}

## Component Interaction

{How modules work together}

## API Design (if applicable)

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
| -------- | ------ | ----------- |
| /api/xxx | POST   | ...         |

## Data Model

{Data structure definitions}

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
| ---- | ---------- |
```

**Transition:**

```bash
./scripts/advance-stage.sh -r /project --to DESIGNING
```

### Stage 4: DESIGNING → IMPLEMENTING

**Trigger:** Design complete, design.md done

**AI Actions:**

1. Execute tasks from tasks.md in order
2. Track with TodoWrite
3. Update progress on each completion

**Guidelines:**

- Follow existing code style
- Add necessary tests
- Commit progress regularly

**Transition:**

```bash
./scripts/advance-stage.sh -r /project --to IMPLEMENTING
```

### Stage 5: IMPLEMENTING → TESTING

**Trigger:** All development tasks complete

**AI Actions:**

1. Run full test suite
2. Execute quality checks:
   - Lint check
   - Type check
   - Unit tests
   - Integration tests (if applicable)
3. Update `checklist.md`

**Output (checklist.md):**

```markdown
# Acceptance Checklist

## Functional Verification

- [ ] Core functionality works
- [ ] Edge cases handled
- [ ] Error handling

## Quality Checks

- [ ] Lint passed
- [ ] Type check passed
- [ ] Unit tests passed
- [ ] Coverage >= 70%

## Documentation

- [ ] API docs updated
- [ ] README updated (if needed)
```

**Hook Point:** `quality_gate`

**Transition:**

```bash
./scripts/advance-stage.sh -r /project --to TESTING
```

### Stage 6: TESTING → DELIVERING

**Trigger:** All tests passed

**AI Actions:**

1. Generate change report
2. Prepare delivery materials
3. Update `artifacts/report.md`

**Output (report.md):**

```markdown
# Workflow Report

## Summary

| Item        | Value   |
| ----------- | ------- |
| Workflow ID | xxx     |
| Type        | feature |
| Level       | L2      |
| Duration    | 4h 30m  |

## Change Summary

- Files added: 3
- Files modified: 5
- Files deleted: 0

## Test Results

- Unit tests: Passed
- Coverage: 78%

## Notes

{Additional remarks}
```

**Transition:**

```bash
./scripts/advance-stage.sh -r /project --to DELIVERING
```

### Stage 7: DELIVERING → DONE

**Trigger:** Delivery materials ready

**AI Actions:**

1. Final confirmation all tasks complete
2. Summarize workflow
3. Mark complete

**Transition:**

```bash
./scripts/advance-stage.sh -r /project --to DONE
```

  unit_tests: required
  coverage_threshold: 70%
  integration_tests: recommended
```

## Available Hooks

```
pre_stage_{STAGE}      # Before entering stage
post_stage_{STAGE}     # After completing stage
pre_task_{task_id}     # Before executing task
post_task_{task_id}    # After completing task
quality_gate           # During quality checks
pre_delivery           # Before delivery
on_blocked             # When blocked
on_error               # On error
```

## Skill Injection

Recommended skills for L2:

```yaml
hooks:
  post_stage_DESIGNING:
    - skill: code-reviewer
      required: false
      config:
        focus: ["architecture", "api_design"]

  pre_stage_IMPLEMENTING:
    - skill: test-generator
      required: false
      config:
        coverage_target: 70

  pre_stage_TESTING:
    - skill: coverage-checker
      required: false
      config:
        min_coverage: 70
```

## Escalation to L3

Escalate if you discover:

- Security-sensitive operations
- Requires cross-team approval
- Complexity exceeds expectations

**Escalate to L3.**
