# ChipCtx MCU Specs

Authoritative MCU chip specification queries for embedded development.
Real-time access to chip parameters, pin definitions, TRM registers, and programming guides
via the ChipCtx MCP Server.

## MCP Server Setup (MUST check before first query)

This Skill requires the ChipCtx MCP Server. Before making any chip query, you MUST verify the MCP tools are available.

### Step 1: Check Tool Availability

Check if `chip_identify` is available as an MCP tool in the current session. If it is, skip to the Standard Query Flow below.

### Step 2: Auto-Install (if tools not available)

If `chip_identify` is NOT available, install the MCP server using one of these methods:

**Option A — Claude Code Plugin (recommended, auto-configures MCP):**
Tell the user to run these commands and restart:
```
/plugin marketplace add chipctx/skills
/plugin install chipctx@chipctx-marketplace
```

**Option B — Manual MCP setup:**
```bash
claude mcp add --transport http chipctx --scope user https://mcp.chipctx.com
```

### Step 3: Inform User to Restart

After running the install command, tell the user:
> ChipCtx MCP server has been configured. Please restart Claude Code (type `/quit` then relaunch) for the MCP tools to become available. Then retry your query.

**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT attempt to call chip_identify or any other ChipCtx MCP tool after installing — they will not be available until the session is restarted. Do NOT fall back to WebFetch or other workarounds. The user MUST restart first.

### Other Agents

See the [README](./README.md) for MCP configuration on Cursor and other platforms.

## When to Apply

Activate this Skill when ANY of the following conditions are detected:

**1. Explicit — User mentions chip model**
- Specific model: STM32F407VGT6, ESP32-S3-WROOM-1, nRF52840
- Series reference: "STM32F4 series", "ESP32", "nRF52"
- Chip search or comparison: "which chip has BLE and 1MB flash?"

**2. Code Context — Chip-specific headers or APIs**
- Headers: `stm32f4xx.h`, `esp_system.h`, `nrf.h`, `nrf52840.h`
- HAL/SDK calls: `HAL_GPIO_Init()`, `esp_wifi_init()`, `nrf_gpio_cfg_output()`
- Chip-specific register or memory address references

**3. Project Configuration — Build system files**
- STM32CubeMX `.ioc` files
- `platformio.ini` with `board = ...`
- `Makefile`/`CMakeLists.txt` with MCU definitions (`-DSTM32F407xx`)
- ESP-IDF `sdkconfig`, Zephyr `prj.conf`

**4. Topic-Related — Hardware discussion**
- Pin assignments, peripheral configuration, register operations
- GPIO, UART, SPI, I2C, ADC, DMA, Timer topics
- Datasheet, TRM, or hardware design references

## MCP Interface Quick Reference

**MCP Server Endpoint:** `https://mcp.chipctx.com` (Streamable HTTP)

| User Intent | MCP Tool | Input | Output |
|------------|----------|-------|--------|
| Find/identify chip model | `chip_identify` | query (string) | Chip list with id, model, vendor, series, matchScore |
| Chip parameters & specs | `chip_specs` | chipId, category? | Core params, electrical specs, peripheral list |
| Pin definitions & package | `chip_hardware` | chipId, query? | Pin table with AF mapping, package info |
| TRM registers & modules | `chip_trm` | chipId, section? | TRM sections, register/field definitions |
| Programming guide & code | `chip_programming_guide` | chipId, topic | Init steps, code examples, pitfalls |

**Key Principle:** `chipId` bridges all queries. Always call `chip_identify` first to obtain `chipId`, then use it in all subsequent tool calls.

### Intent Routing Matrix

| Keywords in User Query | Tool to Call | Priority |
|----------------------|-------------|----------|
| Model, series, find, compare, identify | `chip_identify` | Always call first |
| Parameters, specs, frequency, flash, RAM, features | `chip_specs` | Basic info |
| Pin, GPIO, package, pinout, AF | `chip_hardware` | Hardware design |
| Register, TRM, module, address, bit field | `chip_trm` | Deep technical |
| Code, init, configure, program, example, HAL | `chip_programming_guide` | Programming |

## Standard Query Flow

Every chip-related query follows this flow:

```
Step 0: Verify chip_identify tool is available (see MCP Server Setup above)
        If NOT available -> auto-install and ask user to restart. STOP here.
Step 1: Extract chip model keywords from user input or project context
Step 2: chip_identify(query) -> validate model, get chipId
Step 3: Check matchScore -> confirm unique match or ask user to select
Step 4: Route to appropriate tool based on user intent
Step 5: Format and present results, generate code if requested
```

**Critical:** Step 0 is mandatory on the first chip query in a session. If MCP tools are missing, do NOT proceed — install and ask for restart. Never skip Step 2. All other tools require `chipId` from `chip_identify`.

## Hardware-Aware Identification

The chip identification flow supports automatic detection from project context:

**Automatic Detection Sources:**
- C/C++ header includes: `#include "stm32f4xx.h"` -> STM32F4 series
- Platform IO config: `board = esp32-s3-devkitc-1` -> ESP32-S3
- CMake definitions: `-DNRF52840_XXAA` -> nRF52840
- STM32CubeMX `.ioc` files: project chip configuration

**matchScore Thresholds:**
- >= 0.9: High confidence, proceed directly
- 0.7-0.9: Moderate confidence, confirm with user
- < 0.7: Low confidence, present candidates for user selection

**Multi-Candidate Handling:**
When multiple chips match, present a numbered list with model, vendor, and description. Ask the user to select. Never silently pick a low-confidence match.

See `rules/flow-chip-identify.md` for detailed flow and error handling.

## Context Injection Strategy

After chip identification, inject specification data progressively:

### Layer 1: Always Inject (after identification)
- Chip model, vendor, series
- CPU core (e.g., ARM Cortex-M4), max frequency
- Flash and RAM capacity, operating voltage

### Layer 2: On-Demand Inject (when discussing peripherals)
- Peripheral specs (UART count, SPI features, etc.)
- Pin definitions and alternate functions for specific peripherals
- Package info (pin count, dimensions)

### Layer 3: Deep Inject (when writing low-level code)
- TRM register definitions (name, address, bit fields, access type)
- Programming guide with init sequences and code examples
- Both HAL-level and register-level implementations

### Context Management
- **Avoid overflow:** Do NOT load all chip data at once. Load only what the current task needs.
- **Prioritize relevance:** When discussing UART, load UART data, not all peripherals.
- **Chip switching:** When user switches to a different chip, clear old context completely and load new chip data. Never mix data from different chips.

See `rules/flow-context-inject.md` for detailed injection flow.
