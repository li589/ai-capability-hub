"""Mechanical DIVERGENCE check for narrative-arc candidates — the content-side anti-theater gate.

The design side has had a competition for a while: the direction gate shows 2-4 rendered
directions and `directions_diversity.py` measures, deterministically, whether they actually
differ. The content side has had nothing. The arc was DERIVED — primary goal maps to arc shape
(inform -> build to the evidence, decide -> recommendation first, inspire -> stakes then ask) —
and the planner then recorded "which arc I chose and why". A derivation is not a choice: the
reason is written after the fact, against no alternative, and nothing anywhere reports that the
runner-up never existed. Choosing the wrong arc is the most expensive rework class in the whole
pipeline, because it invalidates the design plan and the build underneath it, not just a slide.

So the planner now produces 2-3 arcs over the SAME evidence ledger and this script checks them.
It is deliberately the same shape as `directions_diversity.py` — same >=3-of-4 rule, same
never-auto-kill response, same "record the justification on the gate line" escape — because the
failure being prevented is the same one: **one mind writing a set of candidates and then judging
its own set.**

But the failure MODE differs, and that is why there are two checks rather than one. Directions
collapse into three colourways of one layout: the candidates are equally developed and equally
shallow. Arcs collapse differently — into **one real arc plus two strawmen**, where the losers are
not similar to the winner, they are just thinner than it. A divergence check alone scores that as
a healthy set, because a two-beat sketch diverges beautifully from a twelve-beat argument. Hence:

  DIVERGENCE   are the candidates different stories?      (per pair, 4 axes, >=3 matched = flagged)
  EFFORT       are the losers real candidates, or sketches? (evidence coverage vs the largest)

The four divergence axes, chosen so no perceptual difference is counted twice (the lesson
`directions_diversity.py` records when it folded `mode` into `palette`):

  shape    the arc archetype itself — the loudest single signal
  order    the first three CONTENT roles. Where the claim sits relative to its evidence is decided
           in the opening third; two arcs that open problem->method->evidence tell the same story
           however they end. The opening role is NOT a separate axis: it is roles[0], already here.
  ask      the closing ask — what the room is asked to do or believe. Two arcs arguing for the
           same thing are one arc with two decorations.
  stance   the audience question AND the pre-empted objection. Matched only when BOTH read the
           same, deliberately conservative: arguing against the same objection from a different
           question is a real alternative.

Text fields are compared by token overlap, and the tokeniser is CJK-aware ON PURPOSE. Splitting
on whitespace scores two Chinese closing asks as 0.0 similar no matter what they say, which would
silently disable the `ask` and `stance` axes on every Chinese deck — the same class of bug as
measuring Chinese glyph widths with Latin metrics. CJK runs are compared as character bigrams.

The overlap threshold is a COARSE signal and is treated as one: the response to a flag is never a
kill, it is REDIVERGE-or-justify, and the justification is recorded on the `arc gate:` line of the
content checkpoint. A false flag therefore costs one sentence; a missed collapse costs a rebuild.
