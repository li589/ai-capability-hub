"""Step 2 must MAKE something before it declares anything — and a blank PNG is not evidence.

WHY. The pipeline gates a motif's CONCEPT thoroughly — a derivation ladder with two middle rungs,
two rejected pictures each with the clause that lost it, the STRANGER TEST, ONE-form-ONE-meaning,
the generativity triple — and its MATERIAL not at all.

Measured on a delivered deck: the concept was genuinely right (a config row, derived from the
product's own `cordis.yml`, correctly rejecting the plug-socket stereotype every plugin deck
reaches for) and passed every one of those checks. What shipped was six grey rectangles. The
repair changed ONLY the material — the same rows became a real config with keys, values and a
`-`/`+` diff — and nothing about the concept moved. No step between "concept approved" and "deck
delivered" had ever asked what the device is MADE of.

The cause was an order-of-work failure, not a missing rule: the design turn carried ~20 required
declarations and zero required artifacts, so effort went into sentences that pass rather than a
thing that works. `signature move: 封面自己演示论点` is a good sentence that was true of nothing on
the page. Pixels cannot be faked that way, which is why the probe is a rendered slide.

Two holes are closed here, and the second is the sharper one:

  MATERIAL PROBE  the design plan must carry a rendered PNG of the signature page plus the one-line
                  "what would the SAFE version have been" comparison — the single field on that
                  plan that cannot be written without having made something.
  FLAT PNG        an anchor/probe image that is one uniform colour is refused. Measured: a 960x540
                  rectangle of one grey satisfied `signature_proof` — the ANCHOR PROOF, whose whole
                  purpose is to put rendered evidence where the design decision is made.
