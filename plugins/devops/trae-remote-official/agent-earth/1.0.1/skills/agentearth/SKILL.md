# AgentEarth Skill

The `agentearth` MCP server exposes 5 tools backed by the AgentEarth platform.
AgentEarth gives access to 1400+ external API tools across categories including
AI generation, web search, maps, weather, finance, e-commerce and social data,
academic papers and patents, media metadata, developer APIs, and news. Use these
MCP tools directly — do not call any HTTP endpoint yourself; the Connector
already handles authentication.

## Available Tools

### GetAccountOverview

Returns the authenticated user's account info. Takes no arguments.

**Response fields**: `user_id`, `user_name`, `key_name`, `credit` (remaining balance), `error_no` (`0` = success).

Call this directly — without `RecommendTools` first — whenever the user asks
about their AgentEarth account, user ID, API key name, or credit balance.

### RecommendTools - discover tools for a task

| 参数 | 类型 | 必填 | 说明 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| query | string | 是 | 面向任务的自然语言描述 |
| limit | integer | - | 返回工具数量上限 (1-50)，默认 5 |

Returns a list of candidate tools, each with:

- `tool_name` — the tool's identifier
- `tool_url` — opaque URL to pass to `ExecuteTool`; **never modify it**
- `description`, `when_to_use` — what the tool does and when to pick it
- `credit` — cost of one call, use this plus task fit to choose among candidates
- `input_schema` — JSON Schema for `ExecuteTool`'s `params`
- `associated_tools` — optional companion tools (e.g. a geocoding/ID lookup tool) that may need to be called first if a required field can't be filled directly from user input

Call this before `ExecuteTool` for any external-tool task. Read every
candidate's `input_schema` and `associated_tools` before picking one — some
fields require an ID or code obtained from a companion lookup tool rather
than free text (e.g. a weather tool that needs a location ID resolved by a
geocoding tool first).

### ListTools - browse tools without semantic search

| 参数 | 类型 | 必填 | 说明 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| page | integer | - | 页码，从 1 开始，默认 1 |
| page_size | integer | - | 每页数量 (1-100)，默认 20 |
| keyword | string | - | 按名称/描述关键词过滤 |
| sort | string | - | 排序方式 |

Use when the user wants to browse or search tools by name/category rather
than describe a task.

### GetToolDetail - inspect one tool by exact name

| 参数 | 类型 | 必填 | 说明 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| tool_name | string | 是 | 精确工具名 |

Returns the same shape as one entry from `RecommendTools`/`ListTools`
(`tool_url`, `description`, `input_schema`, etc). Use when you already know
the exact `tool_name` (e.g. from `associated_tools`, or the user named a
specific tool) and don't need semantic search.

### ExecuteTool - run a tool

| 参数 | 类型 | 必填 | 说明 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| tool_url | string | 是 | 从 `RecommendTools`/`GetToolDetail` 原样取得的 URL，禁止修改、拼接或重排 |
| params | object | - | 按所选工具 `input_schema` 构造的入参 |

Must be called after `RecommendTools` or `GetToolDetail`. `tool_url` must be
passed through byte-for-byte as returned — do not edit, re-encode, or
reconstruct it. Build `params` strictly from the selected tool's
`input_schema.properties`; validate `required`, `type`, `enum`, and
`additionalProperties` before calling.

## Examples

- "What's my AgentEarth credit balance?" → call `GetAccountOverview()` directly (no `RecommendTools`).
- "Use AgentEarth to check today's weather in Shanghai" → `RecommendTools({"query": "current weather in Shanghai"})` → pick a weather tool from the candidates → if its `input_schema` needs a location ID/adcode rather than a free-text city name, call the companion lookup tool named in `associated_tools` first → `ExecuteTool({"tool_url": <candidate's tool_url>, "params": {...}})`.
- "Use AgentEarth to check the current Bitcoin price" → `RecommendTools({"query": "current bitcoin price"})` → `ExecuteTool` with the chosen finance tool's `tool_url` and schema-derived `params`.
- "List the AgentEarth tools related to maps" → `ListTools({"keyword": "map"})` to browse by name instead of describing a task.
- User names a specific tool exactly (e.g. "run ae_qweather_geo_top_city") → `GetToolDetail({"tool_name": "ae_qweather_geo_top_city"})` instead of `RecommendTools`.

## Workflow

1. Account questions (user ID, user name, key name, credit balance) → call
   `GetAccountOverview` directly. Skip `RecommendTools` for these.
2. External-tool tasks → call `RecommendTools` with a natural-language
   description of the task, or `ListTools`/`GetToolDetail` when the user
   wants to browse or inspect tools by name.
3. Review the candidates' `tool_url`, `description`, `when_to_use`, and
   `input_schema`. Pick the best fit by task relevance, schema clarity, and
   `credit` cost; keep a fallback candidate when one exists.
4. If a required param needs an ID/code from a companion tool (see
   `associated_tools`), call that tool first.
5. Call `ExecuteTool` with the exact `tool_url` and `params` built from
   `input_schema`.
6. Never invent a required value (URL, ID, token, code snippet, or other
   concrete input) that the user hasn't provided — ask the user instead.

## Reading the Result

`ExecuteTool`'s MCP result has an `isError` field — that is the reliable
success/failure signal, not a fixed field inside the payload:

- **`isError` absent/false** — the call succeeded. The content is the
  **raw response of the underlying third-party API**, in that API's own
  format (it may or may not contain something resembling `error_no`/status
  fields of its own — don't assume a single universal shape across tools).
- **`isError: true`** — the call failed. The error detail comes back
  wrapped as `<tool_output>...</tool_output>`, often followed by a
  `<platform_annotation>` with a suggestion (e.g. "revise your request
  parameters based on the upstream provider's error message"). Use that
  detail to correct `params` and retry, or fall back to another candidate
  from `RecommendTools` if the issue isn't fixable from user-provided input.

`GetAccountOverview` and `GetToolDetail`/`RecommendTools`/`ListTools` (the
AgentEarth-native lookups, as opposed to `ExecuteTool` passthrough results)
do use `error_no == 0` as their own success signal.

## Credentials

The AgentEarth API Key is supplied by the user through the TRAE `agentearth`
Connector authorization dialog and injected by TRAE into the MCP server's
`X-Api-Key` request header — this skill never sees or handles it. Do not ask
the user to paste an API Key in chat.

If the Connector shows as unauthorized or a call fails with an auth error,
tell the user to (re)authorize AgentEarth from the TRAE plugin's Connector
settings. If the user needs a new or replacement API Key (lost, revoked, or
first-time setup), point them to `https://agentearth.ai` — sign in, then open
the avatar menu in the top-right corner and go to **API Keys** — and have them
paste the key into the Connector dialog, never into the chat.

## Incorrect Flow

- Calling `ExecuteTool` before `RecommendTools`/`GetToolDetail`.
- Modifying, re-encoding, or reconstructing `tool_url`.
- Inventing required params instead of asking the user.
- Treating `error_no == 0` as the success signal for `ExecuteTool` results —
  use `isError` instead.
- Making raw HTTP requests to AgentEarth endpoints yourself, or asking the
  user for their API Key — this plugin only ever talks to AgentEarth through
  the 5 MCP tools above.
